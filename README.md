### **What We Do**

**We Build Real Software**
- Partner with companies to develop production applications
- Work in teams using industry-standard workflows (Git, code reviews, sprints, deployments)
- Ship features to actual users and maintain live applications
- Projects range from full-stack web apps to AI integrations to mobile applications

**We Teach Beyond the Curriculum**
- Run small classes (10-20 students) on topics MSU doesn't cover deeply:
  - Modern web frameworks and deployment
  - LeetCode patterns and problem-solving strategies
  - System design for technical interviews
  - AI/ML integration and prompting techniques
  - Cloud infrastructure and DevOps
- Classes include projects, not just lectures
- Instruction from experienced upperclassmen and industry professionals

**We Prepare for Careers**
- Host panel discussions with MSU students at top companies (FAANG, startups, etc.)
- Run weekly LeetCode sessions where we work through problems together
- Conduct mock interviews with detailed feedback
- Organize system design workshops to think at scale
- Facilitate resume reviews and LinkedIn optimization sessions

**We Support AI Development**
- Every member receives $50 in Claude API credits
- Weekly office hours for AI/LLM development questions
- Space to experiment with cutting-edge tools without financial barriers

**We Celebrate Work**
- The Devvys: Annual project showcase where members present their work
- Recognition for personal projects, client work, and hackathon wins
- Networking with recruiters, professors, and industry professionals

### **How We Operate**

**The Big/Little Mentorship System**
- Borrowed from Greek life's proven 1-on-1 mentorship model
- Every member gets paired with an upperclassman mentor (their "big")
- Bigs provide:
  - Code reviews and technical guidance
  - Interview preparation and practice
  - Course selection and career advice
  - Day-to-day support and accountability
  - Someone who's been exactly where you are
- The relationship extends beyond formal mentorship - often becoming genuine friendship
- Creates multi-generational knowledge transfer within the club

**Project Teams**
- Members work in teams of 4-8 on client projects
- Teams include mix of experience levels with an experienced tech lead
- Weekly standups to discuss progress and blockers
- Collaborative debugging sessions and pair programming
- Code review process where everyone learns from feedback
- Shared responsibility for deployment and maintenance

**Learning Communities**
- Classes meet weekly with consistent cohorts
- Study groups form naturally from class sections
- Discord channels for ongoing discussion and help
- Office hours and workshops throughout the week
- Peer-to-peer teaching and learning

**Social Structure**
- Weekly meetups for coding sessions and hanging out
- Internal hackathons throughout the semester
- Study sessions during finals week
- Regular social events beyond just tech talks
- Community built on mutual support rather than competition

**Alumni Network**
- Recent graduates at top tech companies maintain connections
- Provide referrals, resume reviews, and interview preparation
- Offer honest advice about career decisions and company culture
- Active participation in panels and workshops
- Ongoing investment in current members' success
