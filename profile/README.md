# 🚀 Claude Builder Club @ MSU

> **Your guide from "Hello World" to "Hello, Dream Job"**

We're Michigan State's community for students who want to build real things, learn together, and actually have fun doing CS. Whether you're writing your first Python script or prepping for FAANG interviews, we've got your back. 💚

## 🎯 What We're About

**We walk with you through your entire CS journey:**

🐣 **Starting Out** → First Python projects, debugging together, making CS click
📚 **Leveling Up** → Modern frameworks, AI tools, topics MSU doesn't teach
💼 **Getting Hired** → LeetCode grinding, system design, interview prep, resume help
🌟 **Going Further** → Research opportunities, hackathons, building your own ideas

No matter where you are, there's a place for you here.
