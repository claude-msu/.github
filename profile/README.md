# 🚀 Claude Builder Club @ MSU

> **Your guide from "Hello World" to "Hello, Dream Job"**

We're Michigan State's community for students who want to build real things, learn together, and actually have fun doing CS. Whether you're writing your first Python script or prepping for FAANG interviews, we've got your back. 💚

## 🎯 What We're About

**We walk with you through your entire CS journey:**

🐣 **Starting Out** → First Python projects, debugging together, making CS click
📚 **Leveling Up** → Modern frameworks, AI tools, topics MSU doesn't teach
💼 **Getting Hired** → LeetCode grinding, system design, interview prep, resume help
🌟 **Going Further** → Research opportunities, hackathons, building your own ideas

No matter where you are, there's a place for you here.

## 🤝 The Community Experience

### Big/Little Mentorship
Every member gets paired with an upperclassman mentor who:
- Reviews your code and guides your projects
- Helps you prep for interviews (we do mocks!)
- Gives honest advice about courses and career paths
- Actually cares about your growth

### Build Real Things Together
- **Client Projects**: Ship actual software for real companies
- **Weekly Study Sessions**: Debug together, learn together, celebrate together
- **Classes & Workshops**: Small groups (10-20) learning topics MSU doesn't cover
- **The Devvys**: Annual showcase where you present your work to recruiters and professors

### The Vibe
We're not about competition or gatekeeping. We share opportunities, help each other succeed, and genuinely enjoy hanging out. Think less "networking event" and more "your CS friends who happen to be really helpful." ✨
